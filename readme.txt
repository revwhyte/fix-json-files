I just made this to help a friend :)

Steps:

	- Put all json files in "data" folder (there will be no diff between canonical files or linear files - except for code will uglify linear files, but nothing is perfect, right?);

	- Open your terminal and go to hio's folder (hio is her name :) );
	- type "python arrange.py" (without the '"', but you already know that, people say this all the time);
	- enjoy the magic.


Next steps to this code:

I'm thinking about putting this code into Windows commands, like when you right-click a folder and some actions appear and stuff, something like that (I learned something about it with a programmer couple from youtube, I'll link it later).


Peace out o/
